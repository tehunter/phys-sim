# Final Project
Michael "Tres" Brenan (mb45487), John Herrick (jrh5735)

## Features

See the project writeup in this submission (report.pdf) for more details; our final project implements a Boid simulation
(as defined by the 1987 Reynolds paper) for creating convincing flocking behavior using many independently-acting
agents. 

## Build Instructions

No changes from default build instructions (the final project uses the same build system as all previous projects); our
submission includes third party libraries already.

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j 8
```

## Running

The demo program can be run in the usual style of phys sim projects after compilation:

```bash
cd bin
python3 boid.py
```

Instructions on how to use the demo can be found in the project writeup (report.pdf).

## Source

This submission was autogenerated using a simple packager script, and so includes sources for previous projects as well.
The relevant source code can be found in `lib/boid/*` - primarily in `lib/boid/BoidCore.{h,cpp}`.

## Extra Credit

On our honor, both of us filled out the online CIS for this class. It was a good semester :)
